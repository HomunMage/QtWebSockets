QtWebSockets is a web-based application demonstrating the use of WebSockets for real-time communication between a server and a client. The client is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the server is implemented using Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QtWebSockets.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd QtWebSockets
    ```

### Running the Server

1. Start the WebSocket server:
    ```sh
    python server.py
    ```

### Running the Client

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
    ```sh
    open index.html
    ```

   Alternatively, you can navigate to the project directory in your file explorer and double-click `index.html` to open it in your default web browser.

## Usage

- The client will connect to the WebSocket server and display a canvas.
- You can drag and drop the square on the canvas.
- Right-clicking on the canvas will show a context menu with options to add or remove nodes.
